### Paper Writing Inspiration
This LaTeX template is based on [Simon Peyton Jones'](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/simonpj/) talk [How to Write a Great Research Paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=786&v=VK51E3gHENc). The whole talk should be watched, as it makes for great viewing and is informative,

### The LaTeX Template
The LaTeX template used here is taken directly from the [ACL template](http://acl2017.org/calls/papers/#paper-submission-and-templates). The original template, with all instructions, is also available on this repository, as `acl2017.*`. The "inspired" template can be viewed at [Paper_Template.pdf](https://github.com/angoodkind/paper_inspiration/blob/master/Paper_Template.pdf).

### Contributions
My goal in providing this template is to make it easier to begin the writing process. This is accomplished by
* Providing a number of general pointers about how to structure a research paper
* Providing a non-blank canvas, to make the initial state of the paper less intimidating
